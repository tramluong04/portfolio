    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Tuan and I’m 22 years old. I was born in Saigon. My parents moved to Saigon to build their own companies. I have to admit that they worked really hard to feed me. My dad had to save a lot of money to buy powdered milk for me. They finally opened their own factory when I was in first grade and their life got better and better from that time. They had money to support me better. After 1 year, they opened their own stationery store; their life is wealthier and wealthier.</p>

    <p>They earned more than enough money to feed their siblings and their parents. They also enrolled me in Vietnam Australia International School to learn English. They spent a lot of money and time to teach me how to become independent. However, when I was 15 years old, my thinking was still like a kid. I didn’t care about my parents, always argued with them, and was disrespectful to them sometimes. I also talked back to my mom. </p>

    <p>When my parents planned for me to study in US and live far away from away from my hometown, I didn’t care at all. When I arrived to US, I was so sad and didn’t know what to do. From that time, I learned how to deal with other life. Now I understand how easy it was when I lived with my parents. Living in America has taught me how to live and do things by myself. It makes me think differently. When I was still in Vietnam, my mom did everything for me like washing my clothes and cooking meals for me. My dad drove me to school and home; he even became my second teacher, and helped me to solve my homework problems. And now, I have to do it by myself. It was very hard for me from the beginning, like I had to study by myself or go to school alone, but now it is getting better and better for me. I can do things without my parents. I have met good host family and classmates from first US high school. They helped me a lot and explained to me when I made mistakes and didn’t understand something. They showed me how to eat like an American with a fork and knife. Also, they taught me what I should and shouldn’t do. For example, they instructed me to be careful with the house, because US home is not strong like Vietnamese house. So, I didn’t feel so lonely when I live in the US. If I still lived in Vietnam, I could still be a kid and would make a lot of trouble for my parents. But now everything has changed to a better way. I learned if you don’t live independently and learn how to do things, you are “dead”, because no one will do it for you; you have to do it all by yourself.</p> 
    <p>I have become well behaved and more independent. I don’t have to rely on my parents anymore. I was so happy when I started thriving. There are a lot of obstacles and I have to get through the obstacles to achieve my goals. My parents always said,” Life is a challenge; if you don’t give up and try to find a way to get through it, you will be so proud of yourself”. This speech keeps repeating in my head and that was a motivation for me when I wanted to give up my American dream. So that was my story make me thriving. It was the most important experience in my life. That experience help me to develop myself into an adult.</p>
